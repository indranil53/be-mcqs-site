# be-mcqs-site

## What was this about?
This was a small temporary site that was made by me to crowdsource exam material. This also served as an excellent project for me to learn basics of web framework [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask) and Microsoft Azure virtual machines. This also helped me with understanding of how git works.

## Why?
The current pandemic situation resulted in my university exams getting cancelled. After much confusion, the exams were conducted months later with completely new pattern. So I decided to make a website to help which will properly organize and collect all the available _MCQs_ questions from all sources.

## Is this still active?
No. This was only temporary website. It was active for only about a month. Was initially a private repository while project was still developed. It has long since served it's purpose. But an archive of the site can be found [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20201027163402/https://be-mcqs.ml/).

##
Website used Nginx webserver hosted on Azure B1S VM along with Cloudflare CDN. Some of site stats can be seen below.
